# the length function and it's actually called the L E N which is short for length
#  this is going to give you the count for the full number of elements in a list 
# there is a difference between length and index

# LENGTH
#  remember the counter starts and the index starts at 0.
# even though we have four elements inside the last index item here is actually going to be three 
# how we could get a count of all of the elements in the list.

# how to grab index
#  once you do have the value for one of your elements you can pass it to the index function right here and then it will go traverse 
# through the entire list and return the index of that value.
