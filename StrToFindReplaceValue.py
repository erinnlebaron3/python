#  reassignment is simply just like it sounds, it gives us the ability to reassign a value


sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'

sentence = 'New value'

print(sentence)
answer = New value
#   doing here is when we are redefining this or when we're reassigning new value to be in sentence. 
#  We are not touching the string. All we're telling the Python interpreter is that the sentence variable now is equal to this string. 





sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'

sentence = sentence.replace('quick', 'slow')

print(sentence)
answer = The slow brown fox jumped over the lazy dog

# Replace takes two arguments it takes the word that you're looking for and then it takes the word you want to replace it with

#   not change a string because that's not possible. But to leverage the replace keyword the replace function with a reassignment process


# code
sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.'
