#  integer is a whole number. So it's not a decimal it's not a fraction. It's not a complex number
#  14.99 is a floating point type of data type it may look like a decimal but it's very important to not call this a decimal 
#  the main point to remember is this is a float and there actually is a decimal library inside of python you have to import it manually



product_id = 123
sale_price = 14.99
tip_percentage = 1/5

print(sale_price + new_product)
answer = 0.2


#  one thing it is flexible is with these numbers so you have all of these subtypes such as float and integer and they all can work together
#  float and integer can work togeather
# python combines and turns them into a float


product_id = 123
sale_price = 14.99
tip_percentage = 1/5
new_product = 150

print(sale_price + new_product)
answer = 164.99



#  If I add these together you see that it didn't convert it into a float it kept it as an integer but whenever we had sale price and new product. 
#  And one of these sale price, in this case, was a float then automatically converted the output to be a float to be that type of decimal-based value


product_id = 123
sale_price = 14.99
tip_percentage = 1/5
new_product = 150

# print(sale_price + new_product)
print(product_id + new_product)
answer = 273
