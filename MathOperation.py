#  typically when you're going to be building programs you're going to be putting these in functions and classes and all different kinds of things like that 
#   you could assign this to a variable or any kind of process like that that you want.
#  no need for print statement with these


#  you could put this in some type of addition value variable something like that 
print('Addition')
print(100 + 42)
answer = 142

#  you can also combine this with floating point number. So if I did 100 - 42.3 I could subtract this and we'd get 57.7 so that happens automatically which is very nice.
print('Subtraction')
print(100 - 42)
answer = 58

#  obviously if I wanted to do this with a non-floating point number just like this I can end return and this will work exactly the same way just giving a slightly different value.
print('Division')
print(100 / 42)
print(100 / 38)
answer = 2.6 and 2.3

# floor division gives us. Is it rounds automatically for us
#  It rounds to the very lowest hole number. So the very lowest value that it can. 
print('Floor Division')
print(100 // 42)
print(100 // 38)
answer = 2 and 2

#   The way this one works is it uses an asterix
print('Multiplication')
print(100 * 42)
answer = 16

# use the percent sign and then any number you want after that
#  typically use it to simply find if a value is even or odd. 
# dividing his number as many times as possible and then it's returning the remainder. 
# if it is an even number you're always going to get zero because two will go into any even number and there's not going to be any left over. 
# if it's an odd number it's always going to return 1 unless you're using 1 of course.
print('Modulus')
print(100 % 42)
answer = 16

# exponents look very similar to multiplication. So the syntax is to have two asterisks
print('Exponents')
print(100 ** 42)
answer = 10000000000000000000000000000000 total of 42 zeros
